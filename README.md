### Case Scenario I – Sales & Shipping Insights

### 1. Product Category with the Highest Sales  
 *TECHNOLOGY* – Total sale: *89061.050*

### 2. Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions by Sales  
Top 3:
|Region| Sales|
|-------|------|
|Atlantic|  89061.050|
|Quebec|  45923.760|
|Prarie|  41343.210|

Bottom 3:  
|Region| Sales|
|-------|------|
|West | 2.240|
|West | 3.200|
| Yukon | 3.230|

### 3. Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario  
 *202346.840*

### 4. Recommendation to Increase Revenue from Bottom 10 Customers 

*Bottom 10 Customers and the revenue generated*
|Customer_Name| Sales|
|--------------|-----|
|Ricardo Emerson |2.240|
| Ken Dana |3.200|
| Benjamin Patterson |	3.230|
| Adam Hart |	3.410|
| Andy Reiter |	3.420|
| Maria Bertelson |3.630|
| Katrina Bavinger |	3.770|
|Adam Hart |	3.850|
| Jeremy Farry | 3.960|
| Don Weiss |	4.940|
  
 *To increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers, I recommend implementing targeted promotions based on their previous purchase history and offering personalized discounts to re-engage them. Additionally, bundling low-interest items with popular products can increase order value. It's also important to collect feedback from these customers to understand pain points that might be limiting their spending.*

### 5. Shipping Method with the Highest Cost  
 *Delivery Truck* – Total cost: *164.730*

|2	|Jasper Cacioppo|	Technology|	Office Machines|	45923.760|
|3|	Craig Carreira|	Technology|	Office Machines|	41343.210|
|4|	Dennis Kane|	Technology|	Copiers and Fax|	33367.850|
|5	|Karen Carlisle|	Technology|	Copiers and Fax|	29884.600|

### 7. Small Business Customer with the Highest Sales  
 |	Customer_Name|Customer_Segment|Sales|

 |Dennis Kane| Small Business|33367.850|

### 8. Corporate Customer with the Most Orders  
|	Customer_Name|Customer_Segment|Order_Quantity|

 |Sonia Cooley| Corporate|50|

### 9. Most Profitable Consumer Customer  
|	Customer_Name|Profit|
 |---------------|-----|
 |Emily Phan| 27220.690|

### 10. Customers Who Returned Items and Their Segment   
While the dataset does not explicitly track returned items, I used negative profit values as a proxy to identify customers likely associated with returns or loss-making orders.

A total of 308 customers recorded negative profit, which could indicate returns, over-discounts, or shipping-related losses. These customers were found across all three segments—Consumer, Corporate, and Small Business—with a noticeable concentration in the Consumer segment.

### 11. Shipping Cost Appropriateness Based on Order Priority  
 | Ship_Mode          | Order_Priority | Num_Orders | Avg_Shipping Cost |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| **Delivery Truck** | Critical       | 228    | 47.30             |
| **Delivery Truck** | High           | 248    | 45.19             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Low            | 250    | 44.53             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Medium         | 205    | 46.15             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Not Specified  | 215    | 43.67             |
| **Express Air**    | Critical       | 200    | 8.71              |
| **Express Air**    | High           | 212    | 6.86              |
| **Express Air**    | Low            | 190    | 8.17              |
| **Express Air**    | Medium         | 201    | 8.13              |
| **Express Air**    | Not Specified  | 180    | 8.17              |

After analyzing the shipping cost data across order priorities, it was observed that both Delivery Truck and Express Air were used for all priority levels, including Critical and Low. This reflects a lack of alignment between shipping method and urgency.

Surprisingly, the average shipping cost for Express Air is significantly lower (6.86–8.71) compared to Delivery Truck (43.67–47.30), which is unexpected since Express Air is typically more expensive.

Based on this, two key issues emerge:

- There may be inconsistencies in how shipping costs were recorded.
- KMS may not be strategically assigning shipping methods based on order priority.

### Data Analysis
### Some SQL Queries Used
``` SQL
SELECT TOP 1 product_category, sales
FROM [KMS Order Table]
ORDER BY Sales DESC

Select top 1 Customer_Name, customer_segment, Order_Quantity
from [KMS Order Table]
where Customer_Segment = 'Corporate'
order by Order_Quantity desc

SELECT 
  Ship_Mode, 
  Order_Priority, 
  COUNT(*) AS Num_Orders,
  SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost,
  AVG(Shipping_Cost) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM [KMS Order Table]
WHERE Ship_Mode IN ('Delivery Truck', 'Express Air')
GROUP BY Ship_Mode, Order_Priority
ORDER BY Ship_Mode, Order_Priority

```
