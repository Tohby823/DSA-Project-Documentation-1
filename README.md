### Case Scenario I – Sales & Shipping Insights

### 1. Product Category with the Highest Sales  
 *TECHNOLOGY* – Total sale: *89061.050*

### 2. Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions by Sales  
Top 3:
|Region| Sales|
|-------|------|
|Atlantic|  89061.050|
|Quebec|  45923.760|
|Prarie|  41343.210|

Bottom 3:  
|Region| Sales|
|-------|------|
|West | 2.240|
|West | 3.200|
| Yukon | 3.230|

### 3. Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario  
 *202346.840*

### 4. Recommendation to Increase Revenue from Bottom 10 Customers 

*Bottom 10 Customers and the revenue generated*
|Customer_Name| Sales|
|--------------|-----|
|Ricardo Emerson |2.240|
| Ken Dana |3.200|
| Benjamin Patterson |	3.230|
| Adam Hart |	3.410|
| Andy Reiter |	3.420|
| Maria Bertelson |3.630|
| Katrina Bavinger |	3.770|
|Adam Hart |	3.850|
| Jeremy Farry | 3.960|
| Don Weiss |	4.940|
  
 *To increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers, I recommend implementing targeted promotions based on their previous purchase history and offering personalized discounts to re-engage them. Additionally, bundling low-interest items with popular products can increase order value. It's also important to collect feedback from these customers to understand pain points that might be limiting their spending.*

### 5. Shipping Method with the Highest Cost  
 *Delivery Truck* – Total cost: *164.730*

### 10. Customers Who Returned Items and Their Segment   
While the dataset does not explicitly track returned items, I used negative profit values as a proxy to identify customers likely associated with returns or loss-making orders.

A total of 308 customers recorded negative profit, which could indicate returns, over-discounts, or shipping-related losses. These customers were found across all four segments—Home Office (70), Consumer (60), Corporate (114), and Small Business (64) —with a noticeable concentration in the Corporate segment with a total of 114 returns.

### 11. Shipping Cost Appropriateness Based on Order Priority  
 | Ship_Mode          | Order_Priority | Num_Orders | Avg_Shipping Cost |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| **Delivery Truck** | Critical       | 228    | 47.30             |
| **Delivery Truck** | High           | 248    | 45.19             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Low            | 250    | 44.53             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Medium         | 205    | 46.15             |
| **Delivery Truck** | Not Specified  | 215    | 43.67             |
| **Express Air**    | Critical       | 200    | 8.71              |
| **Express Air**    | High           | 212    | 6.86              |
| **Express Air**    | Low            | 190    | 8.17              |
| **Express Air**    | Medium         | 201    | 8.13              |
| **Express Air**    | Not Specified  | 180    | 8.17              |

After analyzing the shipping cost data across order priorities, it was observed that both Delivery Truck and Express Air were used for all priority levels, including Critical and Low. This reflects a lack of alignment between shipping method and urgency.

Surprisingly, the average shipping cost for Express Air is significantly lower (6.86–8.71) compared to Delivery Truck (43.67–47.30), which is unexpected since Express Air is typically more expensive.

Based on this, two key issues emerge:

- There may be inconsistencies in how shipping costs were recorded.
- KMS may not be strategically assigning shipping methods based on order priority.

### Data Analysis
### Some SQL Queries Used
1. Product category that had the highest sales
``` SQL
SELECT TOP 1 product_category, sales
FROM [KMS Order Table]
ORDER BY Sales DESC

```
2. Corporate Customer with the most orders
``` SQL
Select top 1 Customer_Name, customer_segment, Order_Quantity
from [KMS Order Table]
where Customer_Segment = 'Corporate'
order by Order_Quantity desc

```
3. Total Sales of Appliances in Ontario
``` SQL
Select Province, product_sub_category, sum(sales) as REVENUE
FROM [KMS Order Table]
Where Province = 'Ontario' and product_sub_category = 'Appliances'
group by Province, product_sub_category

```

### Results/Findings
Results and Findings
The analysis of the Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) dataset provided several key insights across product performance, customer value, and shipping efficiency from 2009 to 2012:

- The product category with the highest total sales was identified, indicating a strong customer demand and potential focus area for future marketing and inventory management.
- The top 3 and bottom 3 regions were ranked based on sales volume. These insights help KMS understand regional performance disparities and potential opportunities for targeted sales strategies.
- The bottom 10 customers generated significantly lower revenue. Recommendations such as personalized promotions, loyalty programs, or product bundling can help increase engagement and sales from this segment.
- Among all shipping methods, one incurred the highest cost. This highlights a need to balance shipping speed with profitability and possibly review logistics strategy for cost control.
- The most valuable customers were identified, along with their preferred product categories. This helps in creating targeted campaigns and retaining top customers through tailored offers.
- Segment-wise analysis (Consumer, Corporate, Small Business, Home Office) provided insight into buying behavior and profitability. Some customers had consistently negative profits, possibly indicating returns or excessive discounts.
- An evaluation of shipping methods versus order priority revealed if high-cost shipping methods were justified by urgency. This informed recommendations on optimizing shipping decisions.
- Although no explicit "returns" column existed, customers with negative profit margins were flagged as likely cases of returned items or failed transactions. Segment analysis of these customers was conducted for further insights.

### Limitations
- The dataset lacked an explicit column for returned products. Profit values were used as a proxy (negative profits) to infer returns, which may not be completely accurate.
- The dataset only covered transactions from 2009 to 2012. More recent data could provide better relevance for current business decisions.
- The sales and profit figures had no specified currency unit, making financial interpretation somewhat ambiguous.
- The data did not include customer satisfaction ratings or reviews, which could have enriched customer segmentation and value analysis.
- The shipping method efficiency was analyzed based on order priority and cost, but without actual delivery time or customer satisfaction data.
